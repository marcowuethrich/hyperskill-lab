<div class="step-text">
    <p>All class members—fields, methods, and properties—have visibility modifiers. Visibility modifiers allow you to
        set a valid scope for class members. That is, they define the context in which a given variable or method can be
        used. Visibility modifiers are special keywords that define which part of your code is allowed to use. There are
        four access modifiers in Kotlin: <strong>private</strong>, <strong>protected</strong>,
        <strong>internal,</strong> and <strong>public</strong>.</p>

                                                          title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a>
        is used to tell the compiler that something should be available to everyone. By declaring an instance of a class
        as a public modifier, you can refer to any of its fields anywhere in the program where the object itself is
        available.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">public class Student {

    public var name: String   // property is public and visible everywhere

}</code></pre>
    <h5 id="private-members">Private members </h5>
    <p>Meanwhile, the <code class="language-kotlin">private</code> modifier is the exact opposite of <code
            class="language-kotlin">public</code>. When using <code class="language-kotlin">private</code>, data will
        only be available within a specific class. Let's complicate the previous example by adding a private access
        modifier and a new variable <code class="language-kotlin">id</code>. If properties are set through the
        constructor, then the visibility modifier can also be specified in the constructor for the properties: </p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Student(val name: String, private val id: Int)</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, here <code class="language-kotlin">id</code> becomes inaccessible from the outside, since it has
        a private modifier:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val mark: Student = Student("Mark", 01)

println("Name: ${mark.name}  Id: ${mark.id}")  //Cannot access 'id': it is private in 'Student'</code></pre>
    <p>To protect the fields from tampering, the <code class="language-kotlin">private</code> keyword is used—it makes
        the members of the class available only within the class itself. Now, these fields cannot be changed anywhere
        except in the methods of this class. However, you won't be able to get their value from the outside either, and
        an attempt to output will lead to an error.</p>
    <p>We could use the backing property to define the getter and setter and add more control over the private
        fields.</p>
    <h5 id="protected-members">Protected members </h5>
    <p><code class="language-kotlin">protected</code> is the same as <code class="language-kotlin">private</code>,
        except it can be seen in subclasses. Here's an example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">open class Person {
    protected open val name: String = ""
    private val age: Int = 0
}

class Student : Person() {
    override val age = 18 // age is private and this will NOT work
    override val name = "Eyad" // this will work
}

class Teacher {
    private val person = Person()

    fun printPerson(): String {
        return person.name // Cannot access 'name': it is protected in 'Person'
    }
}</code></pre>
    <h5 id="internal-members">Internal members</h5>
    <p>The <code class="language-kotlin">internal</code> modifier means that who sees the declaring class sees its <code
            class="language-kotlin">internal</code> members:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Bank {
    internal val accountNumber: Long = 5L

    internal fun getBranch(): String {
        return "Branch is Alex"
    }
}

class BankController {
    private val bank = Bank()

    fun getUserAccountNumber(): Long {
        return bank.accountNumber // same module
    }
}</code></pre>
    <h5 id="visibility-of-constructors-in-a-class">Visibility of constructors in a class</h5>
    <p>You can also specify a modifier for constructors: for example, make the class <a
            class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/31660" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
            target="_blank"
            title="In Kotlin, a primary constructor is a special type of constructor that is declared as part of the class header, after the class name. | It can have parameters that are used to initialize class properties directly or within an initializer block. The primary constructor cannot contain any code, but initialization code can be placed in initializer blocks. If a class requires more complex initialization that cannot be covered by the primary constructor, secondary constructors can be used. These secondary constructors must delegate to the primary constructor either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor.">primary
        constructor</a> private. Remember to add an explicit <code class="language-kotlin">constructor</code> keyword:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Student private constructor(val name: String) {
    var age: Int = 0

    constructor(name: String, _age: Int) : this(name) {
        age = _age
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>In this case, the primary constructor is private, so it is accessible only from the same class (for example, when
        calling the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/31660" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
                       target="_blank"
                       title="In Kotlin, a secondary constructor is an additional constructor that can be defined in a class, along with a primary constructor. | They are used when the primary constructor is not sufficient or when you need to perform extra initialization steps. Secondary constructors are defined within the class body using the `constructor` keyword, followed by parentheses containing the constructor's parameters. They provide more flexibility than primary constructors, but they require explicit delegation to the primary constructor. The base class's constructor must be completed before the secondary constructor's body is executed.">secondary
            constructor</a>). Accordingly, from the outside, to create an object of this class, you can use only the
        secondary constructor:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val anna: Student = Student("Anna")     //Cannot access '&lt;init&gt;': it is private in 'Student'
val mark: Student = Student("Mark", 23)

println("Name: ${anna.name}  Age: ${anna.age}")
println("Name: ${mark.name}  Age: ${mark.age}")</code></pre>
    <h5 id="public-and-private-functions">Public and private functions</h5>
    <p>Private functions are used to hide the internal low-level logic implementation from the rest of the code and make
        public functions more brief and readable. Here is an example with the function <code class="language-kotlin">printInfo()</code>
        and <code class="language-kotlin">getAge()</code>. We have set the <code class="language-kotlin">getAge()</code>
        function as private, and this function is not available from the outside. Meanwhile, the <code
                class="language-kotlin">printInfo()</code> function is open, and we can get information about the
        student.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val anna = Student("Anna", 9, 19)
    anna.printInfo()
    anna.getAge()     //Cannot access 'getAge': it is private in 'Student'
}

class Student(
    private val name: String,
    private val id: Int,
    private val age: Int
) {

    fun printInfo() {
        println("Id: $id Name: $name")
    }

    private fun getAge() {
        print("Age: $age ")
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Keep in mind that for local variables and functions, the visibility modifier cannot be set. Local variables and
        functions are available only within the function in which they are defined. We will talk about inheritance and
        subclasses later.</p>
    <h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
    <p>So, let's revise the names of access modifiers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>public</strong> — data is available everywhere;</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>private</strong> — data is available only inside a class;</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>protected</strong> — the same as private, except data can be seen in subclasses;</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>internal</strong> -- who sees the declaring class sees its <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant"
