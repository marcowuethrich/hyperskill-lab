    <p>The <strong>builder pattern</strong> is a creational design pattern that allows making complex objects step by

    <p>The traditional builder pattern is commonly implemented using a combination of a class representing the object to
        be built and a separate builder class. The builder class provides methods to set the properties of the object

        readability and flexibility of object construction by providing a clear and customizable way to construct

    <h5 id="dsl">DSL</h5>
    <p>According to Martin Fowler, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) is a specialized programming language designed to
        tackle specific types of problems, as opposed to general-purpose languages. In Kotlin, with its powerful
        features, you can create internal DSLs to address complex hierarchical problems using extension functions,
        lambdas, lambdas with receivers, and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/29647"

These functions are not operators themselves, and their execution order in an expression is from left to right, with some exceptions determined by associativity.">operator

        particular domain, resulting in code that is easier to read, write, and maintain.</p>

    <p>Now, we will transform this code to a type-safe builder to use it as a DSL. In this example, the type-safe

        chained together to build the tree structure. This allows the tree to be built in a declarative and readable
        way. In the end, you will get a tree object that represents the data structure of the tree. As an example, we
        code a tree structure and the items in a hierarchical structure. The <code

        the root node. The <code class="language-kotlin">child</code> function in the <code class="language-kotlin">TreeNodeBuilder</code>
        class is used to add a child node to the current node. It takes a lambda with a receiver (<code

        child node. Inside the lambda, a new <code class="language-kotlin">TreeNodeBuilder</code> is created, and the

    <h5 id="using-builders-with-builder-type-inference">Using Builders with Builder Type Inference</h5>
    <p>In Kotlin, starting from version 1.7.0, it's possible to use builders with builder type inference, which is
        particularly useful when working with <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/29647"
                                                 rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"
                                                 title="In Kotlin, a generic builder is a type-safe builder implemented using the builder pattern, which allows for creating complex objects step by step in a more readable and maintainable way. | It provides a way to construct objects by separating the construction logic from the representation. Generic builders in Kotlin can be enhanced by using features such as extension functions, lambda with receivers, and DSL (Domain Specific Language) to create versatile and reusable code structures.">generic
            builders</a>. This feature enables the compiler to infer the type arguments of a builder call based on the
        type information about other calls within its lambda argument.</p>
    <p><strong>Usage Example</strong></p>
    <p>Consider the use of <code class="language-kotlin">buildMap()</code>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun addEntryToMap(baseMap: Map&lt;String, Number&gt;, additionalEntry: Pair&lt;String, Int&gt;?) {
    val myMap = buildMap {
        putAll(baseMap)
        additionalEntry?.let { put(it.first, it.second) }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Here, the compiler automatically infers the type arguments of the <code class="language-kotlin">buildMap()</code>
        call as <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">Number</code>, based on
        the information about the <code class="language-kotlin">putAll()</code> and <code
                class="language-kotlin">put()</code> calls.</p>

                    title="In Kotlin, type inference is the process where the compiler automatically deduces the data type of a variable, expression, or function parameter, without requiring explicit type declaration. | This feature is particularly useful in lambda expressions, where the parameter type is inferred from the interface, making the code easier to read. Kotlin's type inference works seamlessly with Java's functional interface, allowing for smooth interoperability between the two. Type inference helps to reduce redundancy in the code and makes it more concise, as the programmer does not have to explicitly specify the type of the variable every time.">type
        inference</a> in your builders:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ensure your builder's declaration includes a lambda parameter with a receiver.</li>
        <li>The receiver type should use the type of arguments that are to be inferred. For example: <code
                class="language-kotlin">fun &lt;V&gt; buildList(builder: MutableList&lt;V&gt;.() -&gt; Unit) { ...
            }</code></li>
        <li>The receiver type should provide public members or extensions that include the corresponding type arguments
            in their signatures.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Supported Features</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Inferring several types of arguments.</li>
        <li>Inferring type arguments of multiple builder lambdas within one call.</li>
        <li>Inferring type arguments whose type parameters are the lambda's parameter or return types.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>How Builder Type Inference Works</strong></p>
    <p>Builder type inference operates in terms of "postponed type variables", which appear inside the builder lambda
        during the builder inference analysis. The compiler uses them to collect information about the type argument. At
        the end of the builder type inference analysis, all collected type information is considered and attempted to be
        merged into the resulting type.</p>
    <h5 id="scope-control-dslmarker">Scope control: @DslMarker</h5>
    <p>In Kotlin, the <code class="language-kotlin">@DslMarker</code> annotation is used to define a DSL marker
        interface or annotation. It allows you to specify a marker that indicates the scope of the DSL and helps enforce
        scoping rules within the DSL. When creating a DSL, it is often desirable to restrict the availability of certain
        functions or builders within specific scopes. The <code class="language-kotlin">@DslMarker</code> annotation
        enables you to define a marker interface or annotation that acts as a signal to the compiler and other
        developers that certain functions or builders are intended to be used only within a specific DSL scope.</p>
    <p>Let's apply this annotation to our tree structure definition:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">@DslMarker
annotation class TreeNodeDslMarker

@TreeNodeDslMarker
data class TreeNode(val value: String) {
    val children = mutableListOf&lt;TreeNode&gt;()

    fun addChild(child: TreeNode) {
        children.add(child)
    }
}

class TreeNodeBuilder {
    private val root = TreeNode("")
    private var currentNode = root

    fun value(value: String) {
        currentNode = TreeNode(value)
        root.addChild(currentNode)
    }

    fun child(block: TreeNodeBuilder.() -&gt; Unit) {
        val childBuilder = TreeNodeBuilder()
        childBuilder.block()
        currentNode.addChild(childBuilder.build())
    }

    fun build(): TreeNode {
        return root
    }
}

fun buildTree(block: TreeNodeBuilder.() -&gt; Unit): TreeNode {
    val builder = TreeNodeBuilder()
    builder.block()
    return builder.build()
}

fun main() {
    val tree = buildTree {
        value("Root")
        child {
            value("Child 1")
            child {
                value("Grandchild 1.1")
            }
            child {
                value("Grandchild 1.2")
            }
        }
        child {
            value("Child 2")
            child {
                value("Grandchild 2.1")
            }
        }
    }

    printTree(tree)
}

fun printTree(node: TreeNode, level: Int = 0) {
    val indentation = "  ".repeat(level)
    println("$indentation${node.value}")
    for (child in node.children) {
        printTree(child, level + 1)
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>The <code class="language-kotlin">@DslMarker</code> annotation is applied to the <code class="language-kotlin">TreeNode</code>
        class, marking it as part of the DSL. The <code class="language-kotlin">@TreeNodeDslMarker</code> annotation
        serves as a marker for the DSL, indicating that the <code class="language-kotlin">TreeNode</code> class is
        specifically designed for use within the DSL. By applying the <code class="language-kotlin">@DslMarker</code>
        annotation, you can clearly indicate that the <code class="language-kotlin">TreeNode</code> class is intended to
        be used within the DSL scope and prevent its accidental usage outside of the DSL context. This serves as a way
        to control the visibility and scoping of the DSL functions and builders. <code class="language-kotlin">@DslMarker</code>
        is optional, and its usage depends on your specific requirements for scoping and DSL design, but it can be
        useful in enforcing scoping rules and providing better clarity about the intended usage of the DSL.</p>
