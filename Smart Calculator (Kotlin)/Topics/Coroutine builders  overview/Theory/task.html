Any method, top-level function, extension function, and even lambda can be marked as suspending. A suspending function is a potential suspension point, and it can only be called from another suspending function or a coroutine builder.">suspending
        function</a> cannot call a suspending function directly. At the same time, many types of applications start with
        regular functions, so how then can we use coroutines? The solution for this is <a

                title="In Kotlin, a coroutine builder is a function that allows you to create and manage coroutines, which are lightweight threads that can be used to execute asynchronous code. | Coroutine builders, such as `launch` and `runBlocking`, bridge the gap between regular and suspending functions, enabling you to run suspending code without blocking the execution of the rest of your code. When you use a coroutine builder, you can control the launched coroutine, check its status, and wait for its result using the `.join()` method. Additionally, when the resulting `Deferred` object is cancelled, the running coroutine is also cancelled. By default, the coroutine is immediately scheduled for execution, but you can specify other options using parameters.">coroutine
            builders</a>.</p>
    <p>A <strong>coroutine builder</strong> is a function that takes a suspending function as its parameter and
        schedules its execution. The builder can be called from regular code, acting as a bridge between suspending and
        non-suspending planes. In this topic, we'll discuss the two most common builders and learn how to use them to
        perform suspending operations, both synchronously and asynchronously.</p>
    <h5 id="coroutines-usage">Coroutines usage</h5>
    <p>Let's say we need to perform some large operation that suspends in multiple places, for example, get a file from
        a server, save it to the disk, etc. At each step of this operation, we want to use coroutines to have concise
        code without callbacks, so we need to build a parent coroutine. We want to wait till the operation is complete
        before we can notify the user and finish the app.</p>
    <p>As we know, calling the suspending function directly won't work:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlinx.coroutines.delay // kotlinx.coroutines is the primary package for coroutines

// pretend we're busy here, there would be some long operation in real-life code
// but delay() is a suspending function so it's a fair example
suspend fun doLotsOfWorkWithFile(file: String) = delay(5_000)

fun main() {
    println("Preparing for hard work...")
    doLotsOfWorkWithFile("a") // compilation error here !
    println("Work is done!")
}
</code></pre>
    <p>To solve that problem, we can use the <a
            href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/run-blocking.html"
            rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">runBlocking</a> builder.</p>
    <h5 id="wait-for-suspending-code-runblocking">Wait for suspending code: <code
            class="language-kotlin">runBlocking</code></h5>
    <p><code class="language-kotlin">runBlocking</code> is a regular function that takes exactly one suspending
        function, executes it, waits until it finishes, and returns its result. This is exactly what we need in our
        situation! Let's give it a try:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlinx.coroutines.delay
import kotlinx.coroutines.runBlocking

suspend fun doLotsOfWorkWithFile(file: String) = delay(5_000)

fun main() {
    runBlocking {                      // this lambda is our root suspending function
        println("Starting coroutine.") // it can contain regular functions
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("a")      // and suspending functions as well
    }
    println("Work is done!")
}</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, our <code class="language-kotlin">main</code> function is not suspending, but now it compiles and
        runs properly: the delay between the two outputs is 5 seconds. We can say that we are waiting for the coroutine
        to finish in the regular code.</p>
    <p>Sometimes, all our code is potentially suspending. In that case, we can wrap everything with the <code
            class="language-kotlin">runBlocking</code> builder:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() = runBlocking {         // here coroutine begins
    println("Starting coroutine.")
    doLotsOfWorkWithFile("a")
    println("Work is done!")
}                                  // here it ends
</code></pre>
    <p>In fact, this is a common approach for simple apps or tests. But what if we need to do multiple independent
        operations, for example, receive two files from two different servers? We can still run them using blocking:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() = runBlocking {
    println("Starting coroutine")
    doLotsOfWorkWithFile("a")   // there is no limit on how many suspending 
    doLotsOfWorkWithFile("b")   // functions a suspending function can call
    println("Work is done!")
}</code></pre>
    <p>Does it work faster than regular code? No! Suspending functions are executed sequentially, and we're waiting for
        the whole coroutine to finish. It will take about 10 seconds. To launch different operations that can be
        suspended independently we can use another builder â€” <code class="language-kotlin">launch</code>.</p>
    <h5 id="fire-and-forget-launch">Fire and forget: <code class="language-kotlin">launch</code></h5>
    <p><code class="language-kotlin">launch</code> is similar to <code class="language-kotlin">runBlocking</code> in
        terms of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/13749" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"

                    title="In Kotlin, a syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that dictate how a program should be written in the language. | It includes the structure of statements, expressions, and keywords, as well as the use of indentation, whitespace, and comments. An expression, for example, is a type of syntax that evaluates to a single value, such as a literal value, variable, function call, or a combination of these elements using operators. Understanding the syntax of Kotlin is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free code.">syntax</a>
        but has a different purpose: it does not wait for the coroutine to finish but immediately returns a special
        handler to the launched coroutine called a <a
                href="https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/-job/index.html"
                rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Job</a>. The coroutine itself continues working, but
        we can check the status or even cancel it through a <code class="language-kotlin">Job</code> object. We'll talk
        about scopes later, now we are using <code class="language-kotlin">GlobalScope</code> for example purposes only.
        Let's take a look:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlinx.coroutines.GlobalScope
import kotlinx.coroutines.delay
import kotlinx.coroutines.launch

fun main() {
    println("Starting")
    val importantJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("important_file") // waits for 5s
        println("Important file processed")    // will only print after 5s
    }
    val notImportantJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("optional_file")  // also waits 
        println("Optional file processed")
    }
    println("Finishing")
}                                              // exits immediately, not waiting for background jobs
</code></pre>
    <p>This code will not print <code class="language-kotlin">Important file processed</code> or <code
            class="language-kotlin">Optional file processed</code> because <code class="language-kotlin">main</code>
        doesn't wait for the launched coroutines and returns immediately. The output would be:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Starting
Finishing
</code></pre>
    <p>To wait for the result, we still need to block the main function:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println("Starting")
    val importantJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("important_file") // waits for 5s
        println("Important file processed")
    }
    val notImportantJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        delay(500)                            // add extra delay
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("optional_file") // so total wait is 5.5s
        println("Optional file processed")
    }
    runBlocking {                             // block main until 6s delay is over
        delay(6_000)                          // by this time both jobs should finish
    }
    println("Finishing")
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Now it will work as expected and print this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Starting
Important file processed
Optional file processed
Finishing
</code></pre>
    <p>Notice that we don't have to wait 10 seconds to get both files processed as we did with <code
            class="language-kotlin">runBlocking</code>. Moreover, if we decrease the wait time from 6s to 5.1s, the app
        will process the important file but not the optional one. In real life, we'd actually need to wait for a job to
        finish, not for a specific time, and we can do that with join().</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    println("Starting")
    val importantJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("important_file")
        println("Important file processed")
    }
    val notImportantJob = GlobalScope.launch {
        doLotsOfWorkWithFile("optional_file")
        println("Optional file processed")
    }
    // we still have to use runBlocking because join() is a suspending function
    runBlocking {
        importantJob.join()  // join() suspends until the job is done
    }
    notImportantJob.cancel() // cancel non important job if it's not done yet
    println("Finishing")
}
</code></pre>
    <p>With this approach, we can launch multiple independent operations simultaneously and wait for their results
        later, cancel them, or do something else. <code class="language-kotlin">Job</code> is a powerful tool here, and
        it provides way more features than we can discuss in this topic: we will consider it in another one, and
        meanwhile, you can check the <a
