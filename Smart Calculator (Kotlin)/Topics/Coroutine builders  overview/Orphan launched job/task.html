    <p>Let's connect to our server again but do a small mistake, so we can see how launched jobs can become orphans and
        never give us the expected result. There is a `connectToServer` function that fails to connect after a second or
        so, you can see that by launching the sample code.</p>
    <p>Your job is to change it to run the connection asynchronously and don't care about the result. After that, the
        program will finish successfully, which is good for the test, but in real life, it would be a problem because we
        do want to know about errors or results.</p>
    <p><b>Tip:</b> Use `GlobalScope` as the receiver of `launch`</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256
