    <h5 id="example-a-synchronized-counter">Example: a synchronized counter</h5>
    <p>Let's take a look at an example and remember how we do synchronization in code. It's a synchronized counter with
        two synchronized methods: <code class="language-kotlin">increment</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">getValue</code>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class SynchronizedCounter {

    var count = 0

    @Synchronized
    fun increment() {
        count++
    }

    @Synchronized
    fun getValue(): Int {
        return count
    }

               title="In Kotlin, a multiple thread refers to a program that contains two or more threads of execution. | Each thread represents a sequence of instructions that can be executed concurrently. A thread is represented by an object, specifically an instance of the Thread class or its subclass. The main thread, which runs the main function, is created automatically in every program. When you create and start one or more threads that will run in parallel with the main thread, the program becomes a multithreaded program.">multiple
        threads</a> invoke <code class="language-kotlin">increment</code> on the same instance, no problem arises
        because the annotation <code class="language-kotlin">@Synchronized</code> protects the shared field. Only one
        thread can change the field – other threads will wait until the thread releases the monitor. All changes of the
        variable <code class="language-kotlin">count</code><strong> </strong>are visible.</p>
    <p>The method <code class="language-kotlin">getValue</code> doesn't modify the field – it only reads the current
        value. The method is synchronized so that the reading thread always reads the actual value; otherwise, there is
        no guarantee that the reading thread will see the updated value of <code class="language-kotlin">count</code>
        after it's changed.</p>
    <p>Here is a class called <code class="language-kotlin">WorkerThread</code> that extends <code
            class="language-kotlin">Thread</code>. The class takes an instance of <code class="language-kotlin">SynchronizedCounter</code>
        and calls the method <code class="language-kotlin">increment</code> 10 000 000 times.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class WorkerThread(val counter: SynchronizedCounter) : Thread() {
    override fun run() {
        for (i in 1..10_000_000) {
            counter.increment()
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>The following code creates an instance of <code class="language-kotlin">SynchronizedCounter</code>, starts
        threads, and prints the result.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun main() {
    val counter = SynchronizedCounter()

    val worker1 = WorkerThread(counter)
    val worker2 = WorkerThread(counter)

    worker1.start()
    worker2.start()

    worker1.join()
    worker2.join()

    println(counter.getValue()) // the result is 20_000_000

            title="In Kotlin, a critical section is a region of code that accesses shared resources and should not be executed by more than one thread simultaneously. | Shared resources can be variables, files, input/output ports, databases, or other elements. For instance, if a class has a field that is incremented by two threads concurrently 10,000,000 times, the final value should be 20,000,000. However, due to thread interference, the result may be incorrect, such as 18,696,438. This occurs because a thread may not see changes to shared data made by another thread or may see an intermediate value of a special field. To manage critical sections, Kotlin provides the `synchronized` keyword, which can be used to create synchronized functions or synchronized blocks (statements) that ensure that only one thread can execute the code protected by the synchronization mechanism at a time.">critical
        sections</a> from simultaneous changes by multiple threads. In the previous topic, we already briefly mentioned
        the <strong>monitor</strong>.</p>
    <p>The <strong>monitor</strong> is a special mechanism in Kotlin to control concurrent access to objects.</p>
    <p>In Kotlin JVM, each object has an associated implicit monitor. So, when a thread captures some object, it blocks
        other threads' access to the object's monitor. Therefore, multiple threads cannot acquire an object's monitor at
        the same time. A monitor can only be acquired by one thread, others will wait until the owner (the thread that
        acquired the monitor) releases it.</p>
    <p>Thus, a thread can be locked by the monitor of an object and wait for its release. This mechanism allows
        programmers to protect <strong>critical sections </strong>from being accessed<strong> </strong>by multiple
        threads concurrently.</p>
    <p>However, this mechanism can lead to a <strong>deadlock </strong>when several processes are in a state of waiting
        for resources occupied by each other and none of them can continue their execution. So, you should use
        synchronization carefully and know how the blocking monitor works in different situations.</p>
    <h5 id="one-monitor-and-multiple-synchronized-methods-and-blocks">One monitor and multiple synchronized methods and
        blocks</h5>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> an object has only one monitor, and only one thread can execute synchronized code on
        the same monitor. </p>
    <p>It means that if a class has several synchronized methods and a thread invokes one of them, other threads cannot
        execute either of these methods on the same instance until the first thread releases the monitor of the
        instance.</p>
    <p>So, the annotation <code class="language-kotlin">@Synchronized</code> and the function <code
            class="language-kotlin">synchronized()</code> lock the monitor of the object to which the linked function or
        block belongs. If we have two instances of a class, each instance has a monitor for synchronizing.</p>
    <p>Here is an example: a class with three methods. Two methods are synchronized and the third one has an internal
        synchronized block. Both methods and the block are synchronized on the monitor of <code class="language-kotlin">this</code>
        instance.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class SomeClass {

    @Synchronized
    fun method1() {
        // do something useful
    }

    @Synchronized
    fun method2() {
        // do something useful
    }

    fun method3() {
        synchronized(this) {
            // do something useful
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>If a thread invokes <code class="language-kotlin">method1</code> and executes the statements inside the method,
        no other thread can execute the statements inside <code class="language-kotlin">method2</code> or in the
        synchronized block in <code class="language-kotlin">method3</code> because <code
                class="language-kotlin">this</code> monitor is already acquired. The threads will wait for the release
        of the monitor.</p>
    <p>The same behavior applies when a class monitor is used.</p>
    <h5 id="reentrant-synchronization">Reentrant synchronization</h5>
    <p>A thread cannot acquire a lock owned by another thread – but it can acquire a lock that it already owns. This
        behavior is called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17901"

                                      title="In Kotlin, reentrant synchronization refers to a situation where a thread can acquire a lock that it already owns. | This means that if a thread has already acquired a monitor, it can enter a synchronized block or method that is also synchronized on the same monitor, without causing a deadlock. This is useful in situations where a class has multiple fields that are never used together, as they can be protected by the same monitor. However, it's important to use synchronization judiciously, as it can reduce the parallelism and responsiveness of the program.">reentrant
            synchronization</a></strong>.</p>
    <p>Take a look at the following example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class SomeClass {

    @Synchronized
    fun method1() {
        method2() // legal invocation because the thread has acquired the monitor of SomeClass
    }

    @Synchronized
    fun method2() {
        // do something useful
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>The code above is correct. When a thread is inside <code class="language-kotlin">method1</code>, it can <a

            title="In Kotlin, invoke refers to the action of calling or using a function. | When we want to use a function, we can invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses. If a function takes one or more arguments (input data), they should be passed inside the parentheses. For example, if a function takes a single-string argument, it can be invoked like this: `functionName(string)`. Some functions not only take arguments but also produce a result, which can be assigned to a variable. Function arguments and producing a result are fundamental concepts when working with functions in Kotlin.">invoke</a>
        <code class="language-kotlin">method2</code> because both methods are synchronized on the same object (<code
                class="language-kotlin">SomeClass</code>).</p>
    <h5 id="fine-grained-synchronization">Fine-grained synchronization</h5>
    <p>Sometimes, a class has several fields that are never used together. It's possible to protect these fields by
        using the same monitor, but in this case, only one thread will be able to access one of these fields, despite
        their independence. To improve the concurrency rate, it's possible to use an idiom with additional objects as
        monitors.</p>
    <p>Here is an example: a class with two methods. The class stores the number of calls to each method in a special
        field.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class SomeClass {

    var numberOfCallingMethod1 = 0
    var numberOfCallingMethod2 = 0

    val lock1 = Any() // an object for locking
    val lock2 = Any() // another object for locking

    fun method1() {
        println("method1...")

        synchronized(lock1) {
            numberOfCallingMethod1++
        }
    }

    fun method2() {
        println("method2...")

        synchronized(lock2) {
            numberOfCallingMethod2++
        }
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, the class has two additional fields that are the locks for separating monitors for each critical
        section.</p>
    <p>If we have an instance of the class, one thread may work inside the synchronized block of the first method and,
        at the same time, another thread may work inside the synchronized block of the second method.</p>
    <h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
    <p>In this topic, we've learned the ways of implementing the mechanism of thread synchronization. Remember, code
        protected by the synchronization mechanism can be executed only by one thread at a time. That reduces the
        parallelism and responsiveness of the program.</p>
    <p>Do not synchronize all your code. Try to use synchronization only when it is really necessary. Determine small
        parts of code to be synchronized. Sometimes, if a method is complex, it's better to use a synchronization block
        instead of synchronizing the whole method.</p>
