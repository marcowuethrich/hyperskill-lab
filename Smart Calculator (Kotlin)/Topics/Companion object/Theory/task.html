        in many cases, you need only one singleton for a class, and using its full name may seem wordy. For example, you

The object declaration created using the 'object' keyword is a compile-time constant, and its properties can be configured using scope functions. Additionally, an object declaration can be destructured into multiple variables for better manipulation or to make the code more concise.">object

This means that an inner class can access members of its outer class. Creating an inner class can increase the encapsulation of your code and make it more organized. For example, if you have a class representing a cat, and you want the cat to have a ribbon bow, you can create a nested class for the bow. This inner class would be associated with an instance of the cat class, allowing it to access the cat's properties and methods. To create an inner class, you need to instantiate the outer class first. The inner class's constructor is called with an instance of the containing class. This means that the inner class has access to the outer class's members and can use them as needed.">outer
        class</a>, and hence it cannot be accessed without accessing the outer class. It allows us to understand that
        the current object is somehow connected with the outer class. For example, we can store the default speed for
        all players in the <code class="language-kotlin">Player</code> companion object. That also means that every

This is particularly useful in situations where a function demands a return type, but it is impossible to return a value, such as when calculating a percentage if the value is zero. In such cases, a function that returns `Instance` can be used. The concept of instance is also related to threading, where only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. This means that different threads can execute methods of different objects at the same time, a concept that can be summarized as one thread per instance.">instance</a>
        contains a reference to the companion object and will return its instance every time.</p>
    <p>Until now, we've worked with a named companion object. However, unlike the case of a <a

            title="In Kotlin, a nested object is a type of nested class that is defined within another class or object. | It is created inside another class and can only be accessed through the outer class. A nested object has its own scope, meaning that you can access the properties and functions of the outer class from the nested object, but not the other way around. Nested objects are useful for creating a singleton that is connected to a specific class, storing data that is common to all instances of a class, and initializing variables. They are a compile-time constant and cannot be used to declare a variable.">nested
        object</a>, the name can be omitted. Let's try it:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Player(val id: Int) {
    companion object {
        /* Default player speed in playing field - 7 cells per turn */
        val defaultSpeed = 7

        fun calcMovePenalty(cell: Int): Int {
            /* calc move speed penalty */
        }
    }
}

/* prints 7 */
println(Player.defaultSpeed)</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, if we omit the name of a companion object, we can still access it through the outer class
        declaration. If we want to somehow use it, we can define it manually. If a companion object doesn't have a name,
        we can also use the default name <span style="color: #66cc66;"><code
                class="language-kotlin">Companion</code></span>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">/* prints 7 too */
println(Player.Companion.defaultSpeed)</code></pre>
    <h5 id="companion-object-and-outer-class">Companion object and outer class</h5>
    <p>A companion is really closely associated with the outer class. You may freely use properties and functions from
        the companion object in the outer class. For example:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Deck {
    companion object {
        val size = 10
        val height = 2
        fun volume(bottom: Int, height: Int) = bottom * height
    }

    val square = size * size             //100
    val volume = volume(square, height)  //200
}</code></pre>
    <p>But what happens if the outer class has a property with the same name as the companion object? Well, in this
        case, the properties from the class will shadow the properties of the companion.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Deck {
    companion object {
        val size = 10
    }
    val size = 2
    val square = size * size // 4
}</code></pre>
    <p>In this case, if you want to use a property from the companion, you must use the companion's name, or, if it
        wasn't named, the default name Companion:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Deck {
    companion object {
        val size = 10
    }
    val size = 2
    val square = Companion.size * Companion.size // 100
}</code></pre>
    <p>Similar to the case of nested objects, you cannot use the properties and the functions of the outer class in the
        inner one. For example, you cannot do something like that:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Deck() {
    val size = 2
    object Properties {
        val defaultSize = size // you cannot get this variable
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <h5 id="limitations-of-companion-objects">Limitations of companion objects</h5>
    <p>Only one companion object is available for each class. That means you can't create multiple companion objects for
        a class because Kotlin does not support this behavior, even if they have different names. If we try to do it, an
        error will occur:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class BadClass {
    companion object Properties {
    
    }

    companion object Factory {
    
    }
}

// Compilation error
// Error: Only one companion object is allowed per class</code></pre>
    <p>However, we can create one companion object and several nested objects:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Player(val id: Int) {
    companion object Properties {
        /* Default player speed in playing field - 7 cells per turn */
        val defaultSpeed = 7

        fun calcMovePenalty(cell: Int): Int {
            /* calc move speed penalty */
        }
    }

    /* creates a new instance of Player */
    object Factory {
        fun create(playerId: Int): Player {
            return Player(playerId)
        }
    }
}

/* prints 7 */
println(Player.Properties.defaultSpeed)

/* also prints 7 */
println(Player.defaultSpeed)

/* prints 13 */
println(Player.Factory.create(13).id)</code></pre>
    <p>There is one more limitation: we cannot create a companion object inside another singleton (or a companion
        object) because that violates the global access principle.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">object OuterSingleton {
    companion object InnerSingleton { // Modifier 'companion' is not applicable inside 'object'  
  
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>If you come from another programming language, you may be a little confused by companion objects. The closest
        concept to it is <code class="language-kotlin">static</code> members. The <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant"
                                                                                     href="/learn/step/10707"
                                                                                     rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
                                                                                     target="_blank"
                                                                                     title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a>
        <code class="language-kotlin">static</code> means that fields and methods with this modifier are common for all
        objects of the class and can be used without creating an instance of the class. You may encounter this keyword
        in several languages.</p>
    <p>For example, in Java, the usage of <code class="language-kotlin">static</code> will look like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-java">class Dog {
    public static int numOfPaws = 4;

    public static String createSound() {
        return "WUF-WUF";
    }
}
/*prints WUF-WUF*/
System.out.println(Dog.createSound());
</code></pre>
    <p>As you may know, Kotlin doesn’t have the <code class="language-kotlin">static</code> keyword. If you need
        something common to all instances of a class, you can use a companion object:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Dog {
    companion object {
        val numOfPaws: Int = 4
        fun createSound(): String = "WUF-WUF"
    }
}
/*prints WUF-WUF*/
println(Dog.createSound())</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, when you use a companion object you also don't need to create a class instance to get this
        function! Remember, a companion object is not equal to a Java <code class="language-kotlin">static</code>
        initializer. In Kotlin, it is a single nested object that wraps all methods and fields which are common for the
        whole class. </p>
    <h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
    <p>Let's recap! Declaring a companion object is a good way to organize your data. It is like a nested object, but
        more closely related to the class. You can freely work with its properties from the outer class as if they are
        the companion's own properties. Use a companion object when you need one singleton associated with a class: it
        is preferable to<span style="color: #66cc66;"> </span>use a companion object rather than a nested class. Now,
        let's move on to practice!</p>
