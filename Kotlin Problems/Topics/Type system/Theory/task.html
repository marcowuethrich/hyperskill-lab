A type defines a set of valid values within a domain and a set of appropriate and consistent operations for the established value domain. In a hierarchical relationship, a subtype is a type that is related to another type (the supertype), inheriting all its characteristics (valid values and operations), but it may also have additional values or operations or restrict the value in some way.">type system</a> is designed to eliminate the drawbacks of Java types and to provide a more straightforward and expressive <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9689" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a syntax refers to the set of rules and conventions that dictate how a program should be written in the language. | It includes the structure of statements, expressions, and keywords, as well as the use of indentation, whitespace, and comments. An expression, for example, is a type of syntax that evaluates to a single value, such as a literal value, variable, function call, or a combination of these elements using operators. Understanding the syntax of Kotlin is essential for writing clear, maintainable, and error-free code.">syntax</a>. Kotlin is a statically-typed language, which means it enforces type checking during the compilation phase.

<h5 id="static-typing">Static Typing</h5>
<p>Kotlin's <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9689" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, static typing is a feature of the language that means every expression has a known type at compile time. | This type information is used for tasks such as type checking, method dispatch, and performance optimization. It also helps developers with tasks such as code completion and error diagnosis. In Kotlin, every function has a return type, and if a function does not return a value, its return type is Unit. This practice ensures full compatibility with Java and offers more predictability when a return value is not present.">static typing</a> assures that the types of variables are known at compile time, optimising performance and improving clarity. For instance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val message: String = "Hello, Kotlin!"</code></pre>
<p>In the above code snippet, <code class="language-kotlin">message</code> is clearly declared as a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>. This clarity helps to prevent type-related errors.</p>

In Kotlin, types are non-nullable by default, and if you want to declare a variable that can hold a null value, you must append a question mark to the type. When working with nullable types, Kotlin requires you to handle the possibility of a null value explicitly, making your code safer and more predictable.">nullable types</a>.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">var a: String = "abc"

Kotlin's type inference works seamlessly with Java's functional interface, allowing for smooth interoperability between the two.

<h5 id="basic-types-in-kotlin">Basic Types in Kotlin</h5>
<p>Kotlin has an extensive type system that includes various <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9689" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a basic type is a fundamental building block for data manipulation within the language. | They can be separated into several groups according to their meaning, and the types from the same group operate similarly but have different sizes and thus represent different ranges of value. Kotlin provides several types for integer and fractional numbers. Integer numbers (e.g. int, long, short, byte) are represented by the following four types, from the largest to the smallest. These types have different sizes and may represent different ranges of value. The integer type range can be calculated as a - (2^(n-1)) to (2^(n-1)-1), where n is the number of bits in the type. Basic types are relative terms, so a given type doesn't have to be one or the other. In this case, a subtype of the type, such as Exception and Error, deals with exceptional events inside an application.">basic types</a>. These function as the building blocks for data manipulation within the language. Here's a short introduction to some fundamental types:</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Int</strong>: Represents a 32-bit signed integer. It can range from a minimum value of <code class="language-kotlin">-2,147,483,648</code> to a maximum value of <code class="language-kotlin">2,147,483,647</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val age: Int = 30</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Double</strong>: A 64-bit double-precision <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9689" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a floating-point number is a type of number that can represent real numbers with a high degree of precision. | It is a 64-bit data type, represented by the keyword 'double', that can store a wide range of decimal values, both positive and negative. Floating-point numbers are essential for mathematical operations that involve decimal values. They are used to represent real numbers in programming and are different from whole numbers, which are represented by the 'Int' type in Kotlin.">floating-point number</a>. It's perfect for representing numbers with fractional parts.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val pi: Double = 3.141592653589793</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Char</strong>: Represents a single 16-bit Unicode character and is enclosed in single quotes.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val firstLetter: Char = 'A'</code></pre></li><li><p><strong>Boolean</strong>: Represents a truth value, which can either be <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>.</p><pre><code class="language-kotlin">val isKotlinFun: Boolean = true</code></pre></li></ul>
<p>In Kotlin, these fundamental types are represented as objects, unlike Java's <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9689" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, primitive types, also known as basic types, are a fundamental building block for data manipulation within the language. | They can be separated into several groups according to their meaning, and the types from the same group operate similarly but have different sizes and thus represent different ranges of value. Examples of primitive types include numbers (e.g. integer, long, short, byte), characters, booleans, and strings.">primitive types</a>. However, Kotlin's compiler optimizes managing these types to be as efficient as Java primitives whenever possible. This optimisation process is called 'autoboxing'.</p>
<p>Kotlin also supports <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/9689" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, explicit type conversion, also known as type casting, is the process of changing a value from one data type to another. | This is particularly important in Kotlin because it is a statically typed language, which means that types are identified and strictly applied at compile time. Kotlin does not allow implicit conversion to avoid precision loss or unforeseen outcomes. When you need to change a variable from one type to another in Kotlin, explicit type conversion is necessary. This is because Kotlin is a statically-typed language, meaning type are checked at compile time and implicit type conversion is not permitted.">explicit type conversions</a> as it does not perform implicit type conversions (widening conversions) for numbers. This means you need to manually convert types if you wish to assign a value of one type to a variable of another:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val i: Int = 42
val d: Double = i.toDouble() // explicit conversion</code></pre>
<p>Understanding these basic types and how they're represented is key to effective Kotlin programming, as they form the foundation for more advanced data structures and operations.</p>
