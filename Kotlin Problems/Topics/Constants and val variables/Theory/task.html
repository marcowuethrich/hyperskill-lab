<p>Sometimes, you need to use a variable that should not be modified during the program execution. Such variables are known as <strong>constants</strong>, or <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a `val` variable is a read-only property or a constant variable, which cannot be changed after it has been initialized. | It is used for variables that are known at compile-time, and the name of a variable declared with `val` cannot start with a digit and should be meaningful and readable to make the code easy to understand. The `val` keyword indicates that the property is immutable and can only be assigned a value once during initialization, which helps ensure the integrity of the data and prevent unintended modification.">val variables</a></strong> in Kotlin, where they are declared with the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a keyword is a word that has a special meaning in the language and cannot be changed by the programmer. | It is used to define the structure and behavior of the code. Examples of keywords in Kotlin include `fun` (used to define a function), `var` (used to define a variable), and `if` (used to define a conditional statement). Keywords are reserved words in Kotlin and cannot be used as identifiers.">keyword</a>. The difference between a <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> variable and a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable is that we cannot modify the value of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable once assigned.</p>
<h5 id="val-variables">Val variables</h5>
<p>The following code introduces two <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables: <code class="language-kotlin">pi</code>, which represents a well-known mathematical constant, and <code class="language-kotlin">helloMsg</code>, which represents a string text.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val pi = 3.1415
val helloMsg = "Hello"

println(pi)       // 3.1415
println(helloMsg) // Hello</code></pre>
<p>Both variables cannot be modified, but they can be accessed as many times as we need.</p>
<p>The compiler will produce an error if we try modifying the value of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable, so an attempt to compile the code below will result in an error: <code class="language-kotlin">Val cannot be reassigned</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val pi = 3.1415
pi = 3.1416 // error line</code></pre>
<p>If a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable is used before it is assigned a value, the compiler will also produce an error:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val boolFalse: Boolean
println(boolFalse) // error line</code></pre>
<p>With the code above, you will get the error <code class="language-kotlin">Variable 'boolFalse' must be initialized</code>. To fix it, assign a value before accessing the variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val boolFalse: Boolean // not initialized
boolFalse = false      // initialized
println(boolFalse)     // no errors here</code></pre>
<p>Notice that the value of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable can be reassigned to a <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> variable without any restrictions and the value of a regular variable can be changed as many times as needed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val count = 10
var cnt = count
cnt = 20 // no errors here, cnt is not a constant</code></pre>
<h5 id="val-variables-and-mutability">Val variables and mutability</h5>
<p>It is important to note that <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> is not a synonym of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an immutable is a type of object or variable that, once initialized, cannot be changed. | This helps ensure the integrity of data and prevents unintended modifications. For example, a list of pages in a book may be an immutable collection, where the content cannot be altered over time. In contrast, a mutable collection allows for changes to be made, such as adding, removing, or updating stored items. Immutable variables, declared using the `val` keyword, are particularly useful for exposing internal state in a safe and controlled manner, as they cannot be modified by external code.">immutable</a>. In the following example, we will use a MutableList, which is an ordered set of elements of the same type. If you want to get ahead and learn more about MutableList, you can learn a <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/topic/1041" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">topic about MutableList</a>, but it is not a necessity right now.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// list creation
val myMutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// trying to update the list
myMutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) // error line</code></pre>
<p>The second line won't compile, since we are trying to reassign a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable. However, there is one essential point to remember.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>It is always possible to change the internal state of a <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variable: while it is prohibited to reassign the variable, its content can be modified in some other ways.</p></div>
<p></p>
<p>So, the following code is correct:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">// list creation
val myMutableList = mutableListOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
// adding a new element
myMutableList.add(6)   // it works
// printing the list
println(myMutableList) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, this code changed the internal state of the <code class="language-kotlin">myMutableList</code> by adding another integer number. When we invoked the <code class="language-kotlin">add()</code> function, we changed not the variable itself but the list it represents.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>If you are familiar with the Java programming language, it may be easier for you to think about Kotlin <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables as Java <code class="language-kotlin">final</code> variables. They are quite similar: both prohibit reassigning a value to the variable but allow changing the internal state of the object.</p></div>
<p></p>
<h5 id="const-variables">Const variables</h5>
<p>In Kotlin, there is also a <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> modifier, which is used before the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> keyword to declare a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a compile-time constant is a read-only property that is known at compile time and its value cannot be changed during runtime. | To be considered a compile-time constant, it must be initialized with a value of a basic type, such as a number or a string, and it cannot be initialized with a custom getter. Compile-time constants should be named using screaming\_snake\_case and can be declared with the `const` keyword. Additionally, compile-time top-level constants can be declared with the `const val` modifier.">compile-time constant</a>. The value of a <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> variable is known at compile time and won't be changed at runtime:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val MY_STRING = "This is a constant string"</code></pre>
<p>The following code will give you an error, since the value is unknown before the program execution and it is not a constant:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val MY_STRING = readln() // not a constant String!!!</code></pre>
<p>There are some restrictions on when the <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> modifier can be applied. First, it can only be used with a <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> or a primitive type variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val CONST_INT = 127
const val CONST_DOUBLE = 3.14
const val CONST_CHAR = 'c'
const val CONST_STRING = "I am constant"
const val CONST_ARRAY = arrayOf(1, 2, 3) // error: only primitives and strings are allowed</code></pre>
<p>Besides, <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> variables need to be declared on top level, outside of any functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">const val MY_INT_1 = 1024 // correct line

fun main() {
    const val MY_INT_2 = 2048 // error: Modifier 'const' is not applicable to 'local variable'
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="when-to-use-val-variables">When to use val variables</h5>
<p>We hope you now understand how the <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> keyword works for variables. It's about time to figure out when to use it.</p>
<p>A good practice is to use <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables by default. Then, when it appears to be necessary for the code, change them to <code class="language-kotlin">var</code> variables:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">var a = 1024
val b = 256
val c = 128
a += b * c</code></pre>
<p>This approach allows you to write programs with the minimum number of <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a mutable variable is a variable that can be changed or modified after it has been declared and initialized. | It is declared using the `var` keyword, which allows for reassignment of a new value to the variable. This is in contrast to an immutable variable, which is declared using the `val` keyword and cannot be changed once it has been initialized. It is important to note that mutable does not mean the same as immutable. For example, the content of a mutable variable can be changed many times if needed, but it is not possible to reassign the variable itself. However, it is always possible to change the internal state of a mutable variable.">mutable variables</a>, which leads to fewer errors.</p>
<h5 id="naming-conventions">Naming conventions</h5>
<p>When declaring <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">const</code> variables in Kotlin, it's the best practice to follow Kotlin's naming conventions to ensure your code is easily readable and maintainable.</p>
<p>For <code class="language-kotlin">val</code> variables use the <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17408" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, camelcase is a naming convention for variables and functions. | It starts with a lowercase letter and capitalizes the first letter of each subsequent word.

Start with a lowercase letter and capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word. Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val numberOfWheels: Int

val isConnectionAvailable: Boolean

val userFirstName: String</code></pre>
<p><code class="language-kotlin">const</code> variables are compile-time constants. Since they represent static, unchangeable values, their names should be in uppercase letters, with underscores separating words. This convention makes them easily distinguishable as constants within the code.
