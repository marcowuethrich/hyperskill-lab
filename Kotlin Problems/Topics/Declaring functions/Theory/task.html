<p>In Kotlin, functions form the bedrock of your code. They define blocks of code that you can execute and reuse throughout your program. A function is a sequence of instructions put together to operate. In a way, it is a kind of subprogram.</p>
<p>Functions play a critical role because they organize code into manageable chunks. They enable code reuse, lighten redundancies, and enhance readability. When you wrap specific operations inside functions, you build more modular and maintainable codebases.</p>

<p> A function has a <strong>name</strong>, so you can <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, invoke refers to the action of calling or using a function. | When we want to use a function, we can invoke it by using its name followed by parentheses. If a function takes one or more arguments (input data), they should be passed inside the parentheses. For example, if a function takes a single-string argument, it can be invoked like this: `functionName(string)`. Some functions not only take arguments but also produce a result, which can be assigned to a variable. Function arguments and producing a result are fundamental concepts when working with functions in Kotlin.">invoke</a> it when you need it. Kotlin <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a standard library is a fundamental part of the Kotlin programming language that is included with the language and provides essential functionality for working with the language. | It offers a robust set of tools to handle various programming tasks efficiently, and it is designed to work seamlessly with Kotlin's language features. The standard library includes functions, classes, and methods that provide pre-built functionality, which can be invoked or used in your code, saving you the time and effort of writing these functionalities from scratch. Examples of functionalities provided by the Kotlin standard library include handling complex math calculations like the sine and cosine of an angle. Standard libraries can be categorized into those that are included with the language and provide essential functionality, and third-party libraries that offer specialized or advanced features.">standard library</a> has lots of functions, for example <code class="language-kotlin">println()</code>. If they are not enough, you can declare a new function and then invoke it the same way as a standard function.</p>
<p>To declare a new function, you need to indicate the <code class="language-kotlin">fun</code> keyword and a function name, a list of parameters in parentheses, and the type of the result value. So, it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun functionName(p1: Type1, p2: Type2, ...): ReturnType {
    // body
    return result
}</code></pre>
<p>A function has the following components:</p>
<ul><li><p>a name that follows the same rules and recommendations as a variable name;</p></li><li><p>a list of parameters in parentheses. Each parameter has a name and a type separated by a colon <code class="language-kotlin">:</code>. All the parameters are separated by commas <code class="language-kotlin">,</code>;</p></li><li><p>the type of the return value (optional);</p></li><li><p>a body that contains <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a statement is a single command to be executed, such as printing a text or assigning a value to a variable. | Unlike expressions, which produce a single value as a result of computation, statements are standalone commands that have a side effect, like changing the state of the program. The result of a statement is not used in the program, whereas the result of an expression often is. For example, in the statement `val x = 2 * 2`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the variable `x`. However, the result of the statement itself is not used in the program. In contrast, if you write `println(2 * 2)`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is passed directly to the `println` function, which then prints the result. It's important to note that a statement can be an expression, but not all expressions are statements. For instance, `2 * 2` is an expression, but it's not a statement because it doesn't change the state of the program.">statements</a> and <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. | It can be a simple literal value, a variable, a function call, or a more complex combination of these elements using operators or other language constructs.

<p>The types of parameters and the result can be of any type including <code class="language-kotlin">Int</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">Boolean</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">String</code>, and so on.</p>
<h5 id="defining-a-simple-function">Defining a simple function</h5>
<p>Let's declare a function that calculates the sum of integer numbers and then returns it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    val result = a + b
    return result
}

fun main() {
    val result1 = sum(2, 5)
    println(result1) // 7
    
    val result2 = sum(result1, 4)
    println(result2) // 11
}</code></pre>
<p>When we invoke our function for the first time, we pass two values <code class="language-kotlin">2</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">5</code> to it. We assign them to <code class="language-kotlin">a</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">b</code> parameters respectively. The function returns the value of the result. The <code class="language-kotlin">result</code> type is the same as the type of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a return value is the result produced by a function after it has completed its execution. | It is determined by the last expression in the function's body, which must be an expression-style statement. If a function has a specified return type, it indicates that the function will not return a value under any circumstance, such as when it throws an exception or enters an infinite loop. Understanding return values is important for writing clean, readable, and robust code in Kotlin.">return value</a> declared in the function (<code class="language-kotlin">Int</code>). When we invoke the function the second time, we pass the value of the <code class="language-kotlin">result1</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">7</code> and <code class="language-kotlin">4</code> as its arguments. The function returns <code class="language-kotlin">11</code>.</p>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><p>The arguments of a function can be accessed only in the function.</p></div>
<h5 id="function-parameters">Function parameters</h5>
<p>As you may know, parameters represent the input data of a function. You can declare a function that takes one or more parameters of the same or different types. Also, you can declare a function that does not have parameters at all, but the parentheses are still required.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">/**
 * The function returns its argument
 */
fun identity(a: Int): Int {
    return a
}

/**
 * The function returns the sum of two Ints
 */
fun sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    return a + b
}

/**
 * The function just returns 3
 */
fun get3(): Int {
    return 3
}

fun add3(a: Int): Int {
    return identity(a) + get3()
}

fun main() {
    println(identity(1000)) // 1000
    println(sum(200, 300))  // 500    
    println(get3())         // 3
    println(add3(5))        // 8
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, we can invoke a function from the <code class="language-kotlin">main</code> function, but it is also possible to invoke a function from another regular function, like in function <code class="language-kotlin">add3()</code>.</p>
<h5 id="return-type">Return type</h5>
<p>A function can return a single value or nothing. If a function returns something, its body must have the <code class="language-kotlin">return</code> keyword followed by the result. Sometimes, you need a function that returns <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, nothing is a concept related to functions that do not return any value or perform any action. | It is often implied in the context of an empty function body, which contains no statements or computations. This means that when such a function is called, no action or computation will take place. Additionally, curly braces `{}` in Kotlin are used to denote a block of code, which can contain zero or more statements. However, when it comes to the concept of nothing, the block would contain no statements, implying that the function does not return any value or perform any action.">nothing</a>. There are two ways to declare a function that returns nothing:</p>
<ul><li><p>omit the return type part:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">/**
 * The function prints the values of a and b
 */
fun printAB(a: Int, b: Int) {
    println(a)
    println(b)
}</code></pre>
<ul><li><p>specify the special <code class="language-kotlin">Unit</code> type as the return type:</p></li></ul>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">/**
 * The function prints the sum of a and b
 */
fun printSum(a: Int, b: Int): Unit {
    println(a + b)
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="function-body">Function body</h5>
<p>You can write any statements in a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a function body is the section of a function that contains the programming statements that define what the function should do. | It is enclosed in a pair of curly braces `{}` and can contain zero or more statements. For example, the function body of a hello world program contains the statement to print the string hello, world! followed by a new line on the screen. If a function has an empty body, it means that no action or computation will take place when the function is called.">function body</a>, for example, inside the <code class="language-kotlin">main</code> function. In addition to the parameters, you can declare new variables that are visible in the function only.</p>
<p>For example, this function extracts the last digit of a number and then returns it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun extractLastDigit(number: Int): Int {
    val lastDigit = number % 10
    return lastDigit
}</code></pre>
<p>You can simplify this code by excluding the extra variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun extractLastDigit(number: Int): Int {
    return number % 10
}</code></pre>
<p>You can perform any operations in the function body. For example, this function uses a relational operation. It checks whether the number is positive or not:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun isPositive(number: Int): Boolean {
    return number &gt; 0
}</code></pre>
<p>The function <code class="language-kotlin">isPositive</code> takes an integer number and returns a <code class="language-kotlin">Boolean</code> value because the result of the expression <code class="language-kotlin">number &gt; 0</code> is either <code class="language-kotlin">true</code> or <code class="language-kotlin">false</code>.</p>
<p>Take a look at one more example. The line after the return statement will not be executed (the so-called <strong>unreachable</strong> code):</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">/**
 * It returns "hello"
 */
fun getGreeting(): String {
    return "hello"   // Ends the function
    println("hello") // Will not be executed
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="single-expression-functions">Single-expression functions</h5>
<p>If a function returns a single expression, you can write it without <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/4580" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, curly braces `{}` are used to denote a block of code, which can contain zero or more statements. | They are also used in string templates to evaluate complex expressions or object properties. If the expression is more complex, curly braces can be used around the expression following the dollar sign `$`. It is a good practice to always use curly braces for expressions in string templates to avoid mistakes and improve code readability.">curly braces</a>. It's an idiomatic way to create concise functions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun sum(a: Int, b: Int): Int = a + b

fun sayHello(): Unit = println("Hello")

fun isPositive(number: Int): Boolean = number &gt; 0</code></pre>
<p>Specifying the return type is optional, as it can be inferred automatically:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun sum(a: Int, b: Int) = a + b // Int

fun sayHello() = println("Hello") // Unit

fun isPositive(number: Int) = number &gt; 0 // Boolean</code></pre>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>A Kotlin function is a special kind of expression that has a body, parameters, and some sort of return. Functions can make your code straightforward. It is always cool when you can decompose a program into small, clear, and comprehensible pieces. To make your code more readable, choose good names for your functions. Remember, a set of concise functions is always better than one big function that does just about everything. And don't forget about idioms.</p>
