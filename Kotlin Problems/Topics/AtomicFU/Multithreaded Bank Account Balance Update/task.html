<div class="step-text">
<p></p><p>Make a program that implements a simple, thread-safe caching system in Kotlin. This system should have the following features:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Tracking Hit Count</strong>: The system should record the total number of times someone accessed the cache, including both reads and writes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caching Operations</strong>: Perform two main tasks: adding an item to the cache and getting an item from the cache. While adding an item, update the value if the key already exists.</p></li><li><p><strong>Supporting Multithreading</strong>: This caching system must be secure in a multithreaded environment. It should work correctly even when receiving simultaneous access from different threads, while preventing data races and other multithreading issues.</p></li><li><p><strong>Testing the System</strong>: Show an example of how to use the caching system with multiple threads. Each thread should be adding and retrieving items from the cache. At the end of the program, display the total number of cache accesses.</p></li></ol><p>You should use atomic variables <code class="java">val hitCount</code> and thread-safe collections in Kotlin <code class="java">val cache</code> in your solution.</p><br><br><font color="gray">Memory limit: 256 MB</font><br><font color="gray">Time limit: 8 seconds</font><br><br>
