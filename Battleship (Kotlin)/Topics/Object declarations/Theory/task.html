<p>In Kotlin, a class describes a general structure that can be instantiated multiple times and in multiple ways. Sometimes we need only a single instance, no more, no less. It can help you organize your codebase and gather similar methods together. In this topic, you will learn how this can be achieved in Kotlin using <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an object declaration is a feature used to create a singleton or a nested object that is associated with the entire class rather than a single instance. | It is a useful idiom for improving programming experience and making the code more readable. The object declaration created using the 'object' keyword is a compile-time constant, and its properties can be configured using scope functions. Additionally, an object declaration can be destructured into multiple variables for better manipulation or to make the code more concise.">object declaration</a>.</p>
<h5 id="singleton">Singleton</h5>
<p><strong>Singleton </strong>is a design pattern that ensures that a class has only one instance with global access to it. This means we can get an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an instance refers to an object or an instance of a class that is created during runtime. | It is a subtype of every known type in Kotlin, meaning it can represent a value of any type in terms of type checking. This is particularly useful in situations where a function demands a return type, but it is impossible to return a value, such as when calculating a percentage if the value is zero. In such cases, a function that returns `Instance` can be used. The concept of instance is also related to threading, where only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. This means that different threads can execute methods of different objects at the same time, a concept that can be summarized as one thread per instance.">instance</a> of a singleton class anywhere in the code. Consider a simple analogy: when playing a board game, all players act within the field of the game. This is a specific single field where the global state of the game is stored.</p>
<p>Before we move forward, let's quickly remind ourselves of the main singleton features:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Singleton class has only a single instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Singleton class provides a global access point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="object-declaration">Object declaration</h5>
<p>Singleton is a really useful pattern, and Kotlin provides a specific structure to declare singletons: <strong>object declaration</strong>. This is a special class with an <strong>object </strong>keyword that creates a singleton. This keyword hides all complicated steps so you don't have to think about the ways to implement this pattern: just use <strong>object declaration</strong>.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at this example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object PlayingField {

    fun getAllPlayers(): Array&lt;Player&gt; {
        /* ... */
    }
    
    fun isPlayerInGame(player: Player): Boolean {
        /* ... */
    }

}</code></pre>
<p>When you use object declaration, the constructor is not available because Kotlin does it itself. To get an instance of our playing field, use <code class="language-kotlin">PlayingField</code> declaration. We can use it anywhere and it will return the same object every time.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">fun startNewGameTurn() {
    val players = PlayingField.getAllPlayers()
    if (players.size &lt; 2) {
        return println("The game cannot be continued without players")
    }
    for (player in players) {
        nextPlayerTurn(player)
    }
}

fun nextPlayerTurn(player: Player) {
    if (!PlayingField.isPlayerInGame(player)) {
        return println("Current player lost. Next...")
    }
    /* Player actions here */
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="nested-object">Nested object</h5>
<p>Often you need to create a singleton that is somehow related to another class. For example, you create a <code class="language-kotlin">Player</code> class to store information about different characters in the game. All these characters can share some characteristics, for example, speed. How would we store such information?</p>
<p>Of course, you may use an object declaration and create something like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object PlayerProperties {
    /* Default player speed in playing field – 7 cells per turn */
    val defaultSpeed = 7

    fun calcMovePenalty(cell: Int): Int {
        /* calc move speed penalty */
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>However, there can be many classes and related singletons, which makes the code confusing and difficult to read. Another way to store this information is by using a <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a nested object is a type of nested class that is defined within another class or object. | It is created inside another class and can only be accessed through the outer class. A nested object has its own scope, meaning that you can access the properties and functions of the outer class from the nested object, but not the other way around. Nested objects are useful for creating a singleton that is connected to a specific class, storing data that is common to all instances of a class, and initializing variables. They are a compile-time constant and cannot be used to declare a variable.">nested object</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Object declaration can be nested in a class declaration. A <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a nested class is a class declared inside another class. | It can access the members of its outer class and increases encapsulation by hiding code from other classes. A nested class marked as 'inner' can access the members of its outer class, while a simple nested class cannot. A use case for inner classes is when you want to create a class that is specific to the outer class and cannot exist without it, such as a ribbon bow for a cat class.">nested class</a></strong> is created inside another class; it cannot be accessed without an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an outer class is a class that contains one or more nested classes, also known as inner classes. | Unlike simple nested classes, which aren't bound to the outer class and require creating an object to use them outside the outer class, an inner class is associated with an instance of its enclosing class. This means that an inner class can access members of its outer class. Creating an inner class can increase the encapsulation of your code and make it more organized. For example, if you have a class representing a cat, and you want the cat to have a ribbon bow, you can create a nested class for the bow. This inner class would be associated with an instance of the cat class, allowing it to access the cat's properties and methods. To create an inner class, you need to instantiate the outer class first. The inner class's constructor is called with an instance of the containing class. This means that the inner class has access to the outer class's members and can use them as needed.">outer class</a> declaration.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class OuterClass {  
   //outer class code  
    class NestedClass {  
      //nested class code  
    }  
}  </code></pre>
<p>Now, let's take a closer look at a nested object construction:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Player(val id: Int) {
    object Properties {
        /* Default player speed in playing field – 7 cells per turn */
        val defaultSpeed = 7

        fun calcMovePenalty(cell: Int): Int {
            /* calc move speed penalty */
        }
    }
}

/* prints 7 */
println(Player.Properties.defaultSpeed)</code></pre>
<p>The object <code class="language-kotlin">Properties</code> has the scope <code class="language-kotlin">Player</code>, which means we can access it only through <code class="language-kotlin">Player.Properties</code>. That's how you can create a singleton connected to a special class.</p>
<p>You can also use properties and functions from a nested object in the outer class. This can be useful for storing some data common to all instances of a class and for initializing variables. For example: </p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Player(val id: Int) {
    object Properties {
        val defaultSpeed = 7
    }
    
    val superSpeed = Properties.defaultSpeed * 2 // 14
}</code></pre>
<p>The opposite is not true. You cannot use the properties and the functions of the outer class in the inner. For example, you cannot do something like that:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Player(val id: Int) {    
    val speed = 7
    object Properties {
        val defaultSpeed = speed // you cannot get this variable
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it's similar to <strong>static</strong> in the other languages. Kotlin doesn't provide static members by default, but you may use nested objects if you need something related to the class.</p>
<h5 id="compile-time-constants">Compile-time constants</h5>
<p>As you know, sometimes it is necessary to use values in your code that will never change. We call them <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a constant value is a type of read-only property that is declared using the `const` keyword and is known at compile-time. | It must be initialized with a value of a basic type, such as an integer or a string, and cannot be modified during program execution. Constant values should be named using screaming snake case and should have a meaningful name. Constant values differ from regular variables or `val` variables in that they are completely immutable and cannot be modified even within the same function or block of code. This is because their values are known at compile-time and are therefore fixed. It is generally recommended to avoid using constant values when a regular variable or `val` variable would suffice, as constant values can make code more difficult to read and maintain.">constant values</a></strong>. So, if you know that some <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a read-only property is a property that can only be read and not modified. | It is achieved by using the `val` keyword instead of `var` when declaring the property. The `val` keyword indicates that the property is immutable and can only be assigned a value once during initialization. This helps ensure the integrity of the data and prevent unintended modification. Additionally, read-only properties can be used to expose internal state in a safe and controlled manner, without allowing external code to modify it.">read-only property</a> that belongs to your object is a constant,  you can declare it as <code class="language-kotlin">const</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object Languages {
    const val FAVORITE_LANGUAGE = "Kotlin"

    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>The values of such constants are already known at compile time, so they are called <strong><a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a compile-time constant is a read-only property that is known at compile time and its value cannot be changed during runtime. | To be considered a compile-time constant, it must be initialized with a value of a basic type, such as a number or a string, and it cannot be initialized with a custom getter. Compile-time constants should be named using screaming\_snake\_case and can be declared with the `const` keyword. Additionally, compile-time top-level constants can be declared with the `const val` modifier.">compile-time constants</a></strong>. Note that the constant must meet the following requirements: firstly, it must be initialized with a value of type <code class="language-kotlin">String</code> or a basic type (<code class="language-kotlin">Int</code>, <code class="language-kotlin">Double</code>, etc.). Also, it cannot be a <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/10511" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">custom getter</a>. And remember that constants should be named using the SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.</p>
<p>By the way, if we know that the <code class="language-kotlin">defaultSpeed</code> property in the game is a constant, then we can make changes to the examples above as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object Properties {
    /* Constant default player speed */
    const val DEFAULT_SPEED = 7

    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>You can access this property from outside the object like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object Properties {
    /* Constant default player speed */
    const val DEFAULT_SPEED = 7

    // ...
}

fun main() {
    println(Properties.DEFAULT_SPEED) // 7
    
    // ...
}</code></pre>
<p>You might wonder: why not just declare all constants as top-level? Why do we need to declare them in an object?</p>
<p>Generally speaking, both approaches may make sense depending on the situation. The fact is that careless use of top-level properties reduces the readability and organization of the code and, as a result, leads to unpleasant errors. If you declare all the constants at the top of the file, then eventually, you may realize that in one place you have hundreds of declarations that are not related to each other. Therefore, if a constant refers to a specific object, it is better to declare it in that object. </p>

<p> </p>
<h5 id="objects-and-nested-objects">Objects and nested objects</h5>
<p>Let's discuss additional features. Sometimes you want to create more than one singleton associated with a class. You can declare any number of objects inside another class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Player(val id: Int) {
    object Properties {
        /* Default player speed in playing field – 7 cells per turn */
        val defaultSpeed = 7

        fun calcMovePenalty(cell: Int): Int {
            /* calc move speed penalty */
        }
    }

    /* creates a new instance of Player */
    object Factory {
        fun create(playerId: Int): Player {
            return Player(playerId)
        }
    }
}

/* prints 7 */
println(Player.Properties.defaultSpeed)


/* prints 13 */
println(Player.Factory.create(13).id)</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we've created an additional singleton that can create a new instance of the class. This pattern is called <strong>Factory </strong>and can be really useful for complex cases. You can read about this pattern <a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/17108" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>. The usual way to use this pattern is through nested objects.</p>
<p>Another useful feature of nested objects is that you can declare any number of objects inside another object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object Game {
    object Properties {
        val maxPlayersCount = 13
        val maxGameDurationInSec = 2400
    }

    object Info {
        val name = "My super game"
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>This is helpful for organizing the data in the singletons.</p>
<h5 id="data-objects">Data objects</h5>
<p>When printing a plain object declaration in Kotlin, the string representation contains both its name and the hash of the object.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object MyObject

fun main() {
    println(MyObject) // MyObject@1f32e575
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like<a href="https://hyperskill.org/learn/step/8526" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"> data classes</a>, you can mark an object declaration with the data modifier. This instructs the compiler to generate a number of functions for your object:</p>
<ul>
<li>toString() returns the name of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/10698" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a data object is a special type of class known as a data class, which automatically provides implementations of methods such as `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` based on the properties defined in the class. | Data classes are useful for representing simple data structures, such as a record in a database or a data transfer object in a network service. They are declared using the `data` keyword followed by the class name and its properties. In contrast to regular objects, data objects do not typically contain any implementation logic, but rather serve as simple containers for data.">data object</a></li>
<li>equals()/hashCode() pair</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">data object MySingleton

fun main() {
    println(MySingleton) // MySingleton
}</code></pre>
<p>You should not confuse this functionality with what already exists in data classes.  A data object declaration is intended to be used as singleton objects, no <code class="language-kotlin">copy()</code> function is generated. The singleton pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance, which would be violated by allowing copies of the instance to be created. Unlike a data class, a data object does not have any data properties. Since attempting to destructure such an object without data properties would not make sense, no <code class="language-kotlin">componentN()</code> functions are generated.</p>
<h5 id="idiom">Idiom</h5>
<p>As you can see, the singleton is a powerful tool. In many languages, you would have to write such a class yourself, but Kotlin recommends using <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/docs/idioms.html#create-a-singleton" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">object declaration</a> as a standard solution.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">object Resource {
    val name = "Name"
}</code></pre>
<p>Also, we can configure properties of an object using the scope function <code class="language-kotlin">apply</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-kotlin">val myRectangle = Rectangle().apply {
    length = 4
    breadth = 5
    color = 0xFAFAFA
}</code></pre>
<h5 id="summary">Summary</h5>
<p>Object declaration is a useful feature. Mainly, we can use the <code class="language-kotlin">object</code> keyword to create singletons. Another use of object declaration is nested objects. It is an easy way to create a structure that is associated with the entire class rather than a single instance. If you use it wisely and correctly, you can improve your programming experience and make your code more readable.</p>
