    <h5 id="important-terms-and-concepts">Important terms and concepts</h5>
    <p>Before we start using synchronization in our code, let's introduce the necessary terms and concepts.</p>
    <p><strong>1) Thread synchronization </strong>is a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent threads do
        not simultaneously execute a code segment called a <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant"
                                                              href="/learn/step/17871"

                                                              title="In Kotlin, a critical section is a region of code that accesses shared resources and should not be executed by more than one thread simultaneously. | Shared resources can be variables, files, input/output ports, databases, or other elements. For instance, if a class has a field that is incremented by two threads concurrently 10,000,000 times, the final value should be 20,000,000. However, due to thread interference, the result may be incorrect, such as 18,696,438. This occurs because a thread may not see changes to shared data made by another thread or may see an intermediate value of a special field. To manage critical sections, Kotlin provides the `synchronized` keyword, which can be used to create synchronized functions or synchronized blocks (statements) that ensure that only one thread can execute the code protected by the synchronization mechanism at a time.">critical
            section</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>2) A critical section</strong> is a region of code that accesses shared resources and should not be
        executed by more than one thread at the same time. A shared resource may be a variable, file, input/output port,
        database, or something else.</p>
    <p>Let's consider an example. Let some class <code class="language-kotlin">Counter</code> have a field named <code
            class="language-kotlin">count</code>:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class Counter {
    var count = 0

    fun inc() {
        count++
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Two threads concurrently increment the field (increase it by 1) 10 000 000 times.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">import kotlin.concurrent.thread

fun main() {
    val counterInstance = Counter()
    val thread1 = thread(block = {
        for (i in 1..10_000_000) {
            counterInstance.inc();
        }
    })
    val thread2 = thread(block = {
        for (i in 1..10_000_000) {
            counterInstance.inc();
        }
    })
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()
    println("The result of the threads' work: ${counterInstance.count}")
}</code></pre>
    <p>The final value should be 20 000 000. However, when the program ends its work, we have a different, wrong result,
        for example, 18 696 438.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">The result of the threads' work: 18696438</code></pre>
    <p>This happens because sometimes a thread does not see the changes of shared data made by another thread, and
        sometimes a thread may see an intermediate value of a non-atomic operation. Those are examples of visibility and
        atomicity problems we deal with while working with shared data.</p>
    <p>That is why increasing a value by multiple threads is a <strong>critical section</strong>. Of course, this
        example is very simple, and a critical section may be way more complex.</p>
    <h5 id="code-synchronizing">Code synchronizing</h5>
    <p>The "classic" and simplest way to protect code from being concurrently accessed by multiple threads involves
        using synchronized methods.</p>
    <p>There are two different forms of synchronization:</p>

                  title="In Kotlin, a synchronized function is a function that is marked with the `synchronized` keyword using annotations. | It ensures that only one thread can execute the code within the function at a time. This is achieved by locking the monitor of the instance to which the function belongs. When a thread invokes and executes the statement inside the synchronized function, no other thread can execute the statement inside any other synchronized function or block in the same instance because the monitor is already acquired. The thread will wait for the release of the monitor before it can proceed.">synchronized
            function</a> (we use the annotation <code class="language-kotlin">@Synchronized</code>):</p></li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">@Synchronized fun myFunction() {
    //do something
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Note that <strong>annotations</strong> are a means of attaching metadata to code; in the following topics, you
        will learn more about them. For now, just remember that <code class="language-kotlin">@Synchronized</code> is an
        easy way to tell the compiler that a method can only be used by one thread at a time.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>synchronized blocks or statements (we use the function <code
                class="language-kotlin">synchronized()</code>):</p></li>
    </ul>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin"> fun myOtherFunction() {
 
    // a synchronized block
    synchronized(this) {
         // block's code
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>A synchronized function or block needs an object for locking threads. Only one thread can execute code in a
        synchronized block or method at the same time. Other threads are blocked until the thread inside the
        synchronized block or method exits it.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at examples of synchronized blocks and functions and discuss some important aspects of
        protecting your code from being accessed by multiple threads concurrently.</p>
    <h5 id="synchronized-functions">Synchronized functions</h5>
    <p>Now then, functions are synchronized by the annotation <code class="language-kotlin">@Synchronized</code>.</p>
    <p>Only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. Meanwhile, different threads
        can execute methods of different objects at the same time. This can be summarized as <em>"one thread per
            instance"</em>.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a class with a single synchronized method named <code
            class="language-kotlin">doSomething()</code>. The class also has a constructor for distinguishing <a

            title="In Kotlin, an instance refers to an object or an instance of a class that is created during runtime. | It is a subtype of every known type in Kotlin, meaning it can represent a value of any type in terms of type checking. This is particularly useful in situations where a function demands a return type, but it is impossible to return a value, such as when calculating a percentage if the value is zero. In such cases, a function that returns `Instance` can be used. The concept of instance is also related to threading, where only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. This means that different threads can execute methods of different objects at the same time, a concept that can be summarized as one thread per instance.">instances</a>.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class SomeClass(val className: String) {
    @Synchronized
    fun doSomething() {
        val threadName = Thread.currentThread().name
        println("$threadName entered the method of $className")
        println("$threadName leaves the method of $className")
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>We have a class <code class="language-kotlin">MyThread</code> – it extends the <code class="language-kotlin">Thread</code>
        class and tries to <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/17871"

                              title="In Kotlin, a call is the execution of a function in a program. | It involves adding a new stack frame to the call stack, which stores information about the function, such as its parameters, local variables, return address, and intermediate computations. The call stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle, meaning that the most recently added function call is executed first. If a function calls another function, a new stack frame is added to the call stack, and the execution proceeds to the newly called function. When a function finishes executing, its corresponding stack frame is removed from the call stack, and the execution proceeds to the next top function.">call</a>
        the method <code class="language-kotlin">doSomething()</code> of the instance which it takes as a parameter.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class MyThread(val classInstance: SomeClass) : Thread() {
    override fun run() {
        classInstance.doSomething()
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>Let's create two instances of the class and three threads invoking <code
            class="language-kotlin">doSomething()</code>. The first and second threads take the same instance of the
        class, and the third thread takes a different one.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">val instance1 = SomeClass("instance-1")
val instance2 = SomeClass("instance-2")

val first = MyThread(instance1)
val second = MyThread(instance1)
val third = MyThread(instance2)

first.start()
second.start()
third.start()</code></pre>
    <p>The result will look like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-no-highlight">Thread-0 entered the method of instance-1
Thread-2 entered the method of instance-2
Thread-0 leaves the method of instance-1
Thread-1 entered the method of instance-1
Thread-2 leaves the method of instance-2
Thread-1 leaves the method of instance-1</code></pre>
    <p>As you can see, there are no threads executing the code in <code class="language-kotlin">doSomething</code> of
        <code class="language-kotlin">instance-1</code> at the same time. Try running it several times.</p>
    <h5 id="synchronized-blocks-statements">Synchronized blocks (statements)</h5>
    <p>Sometimes, you need to synchronize only a part of a method. This is possible with the function <code
            class="language-kotlin">synchronized()</code>.</p>
    <p>Here is a class with the <code class="language-kotlin">changeValue()</code> method, which is unsynchronized but
        has a synchronized part inside it, where we change the value of the <code
                class="language-kotlin">Someclass</code> instance.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-kotlin">class SomeClass {
    var value = 0
    fun changeValue(newValue: Int) {

        // unsynchronized code
        print("I'd like to change the value for $newValue")
        synchronized(this) { // synchronization on the class
            // synchronized code
            value = newValue
        }
        print("The value has been changed successfully!")
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>The block inside <code class="language-kotlin">changeValue()</code> is synchronized on <code
            class="language-kotlin">this</code> instance, which means that only one thread can change the value of the
        instance. However, some other thread is able to change the value of another instance at the same time.</p>
    <p>Synchronized blocks may resemble synchronized methods, but they allow programmers to synchronize only the
        necessary part of a method.</p>
