<h5 id="introduction">Introduction</h5>
<p>When you have already learned the basics of programming in Kotlin and the capabilities of the language, you move on to creating larger and more serious projects to develop your skills. In such projects, you think not only about the correct code execution but also about its effective execution. This is where you need <strong>threads</strong>, which allow you to execute some actions in your program in parallel instead of sequentially.</p>
<p>In this topic, you will learn what Kotlin threads are and how you can work with them in your code.</p>
<h5 id="threads-in-kotlin">Threads in Kotlin</h5>
<p>Kotlin was originally designed with built-in multithreading support. Threads are supported on the level of the JVM, the level of the language (special keywords), and the level of the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a standard library is a fundamental part of the Kotlin programming language that is included with the language and provides essential functionality for working with the language. | It offers a robust set of tools to handle various programming tasks efficiently, and it is designed to work seamlessly with Kotlin's language features. The standard library includes functions, classes, and methods that provide pre-built functionality, which can be invoked or used in your code, saving you the time and effort of writing these functionalities from scratch. Examples of functionalities provided by the Kotlin standard library include handling complex math calculations like the sine and cosine of an angle. Standard libraries can be categorized into those that are included with the language and provide essential functionality, and third-party libraries that offer specialized or advanced features.">standard library</a>. Every Kotlin program has at least one thread, which is called <strong>main</strong>; it is created automatically by the JVM process to execute <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, a statement is a single command to be executed, such as printing a text or assigning a value to a variable. | Unlike expressions, which produce a single value as a result of computation, statements are standalone commands that have a side effect, like changing the state of the program. The result of a statement is not used in the program, whereas the result of an expression often is. For example, in the statement `val x = 2 * 2`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is assigned to the variable `x`. However, the result of the statement itself is not used in the program. In contrast, if you write `println(2 * 2)`, the expression `2 * 2` is evaluated, and its result is passed directly to the `println` function, which then prints the result. It's important to note that a statement can be an expression, but not all expressions are statements. For instance, `2 * 2` is an expression, but it's not a statement because it doesn't change the state of the program.">statements</a> inside the <code class="java">main()</code> function. Any Kotlin program has some other default threads as well (for example, a separate thread for the garbage collector).</p>
<p>Throughout all stages of development of the Kotlin language, the approach to multithreading has changed from the use of low-level threads to some high-level abstractions. However, understanding the fundamental concept remains very important for a good developer.</p>
<h5 id="a-class-for-threads">A class for threads</h5>
<p>A thread is a sequence of instructions that a program can execute when it runs. Each thread is represented by an object â€“ an <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, an instance refers to an object or an instance of a class that is created during runtime. | It is a subtype of every known type in Kotlin, meaning it can represent a value of any type in terms of type checking. This is particularly useful in situations where a function demands a return type, but it is impossible to return a value, such as when calculating a percentage if the value is zero. In such cases, a function that returns `Instance` can be used. The concept of instance is also related to threading, where only one thread can execute code in a synchronized method of a particular instance. This means that different threads can execute methods of different objects at the same time, a concept that can be summarized as one thread per instance.">instance</a> of the <code class="java">java.lang.Thread</code> class (or its subclass).</p>
<p>As you know, every program creates at least one thread: the <a class="theory-lookup not-relevant" href="/learn/step/15809" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Kotlin, the main thread refers to the primary thread of execution in a program, created automatically by the JVM process to execute statements inside the main function. | It is the starting point from where you can create and spawn new threads to perform tasks. Every Kotlin program has at least one main thread, and it can be manipulated like any other thread, with features such as name, identifier, priority, and other characteristics accessible through its functions. Although Kotlin has evolved from low-level thread usage to high-level abstractions, understanding the main thread remains crucial for effective multithreading.">main thread</a>, which runs the <code class="java">main()</code> function, and such a program is called a single thread program. If you create one or more threads that will be performed in parallel, it becomes a multithreaded program. In the following topics, you will learn how to create your own thread, which will perform a certain sequence of actions. But now, let's try to look at the thread that executes at the moment.</p>
<p>The <code class="java">Thread</code> class has a static method named <code class="java">currentThread</code> to obtain a reference to the currently executing thread object:</p>
<pre><code class="java">val thread: Thread = Thread.currentThread() // the current thread</code></pre>
<p>The <code class="java">Thread</code> class stores basic information about the thread: its name, identifier (<code class="java">long</code>), priority, and some other characteristics that can be obtained through its functions. Let's study them in more detail and take the thread <code class="java">main</code> as an example.</p>
<h5 id="the-information-on-the-main-thread">The information on the main thread</h5>
<p>The example below demonstrates how to obtain the characteristics of the main<strong> </strong>thread by making references to it through an object of the <code class="java">Thread</code>class.</p>
<pre><code class="java">fun main() {
    val t: Thread = Thread.currentThread() // main thread

    println("Name: ${t.name}")
    println("ID: ${t.id}")
    println("Alive: ${t.isAlive}")
    println("Priority: ${t.priority}")
    println("Daemon: ${t.isDaemon}")
}
</code></pre>
<p>All statements in this program are executed by the main thread. You can see the general information about this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li><code class="java">t.name</code> returns the thread's name;</li>
<li><code class="java">t.id</code> returns the thread's unique identifier;</li>
<li><code class="java">t.isAlive</code> tells us whether the thread has been started and hasn't died yet;</li>
<li><code class="java">t.priority</code> returns the priority of the given thread. Every thread has a <strong>priority </strong>that determines the order of execution: threads with a higher priority are executed before threads with lower priorities;</li>
<li><code class="java">t.isDaemon</code> checks whether the thread is a <strong>daemon</strong>. A daemon thread (comes from UNIX terminology) is a low priority thread that runs in the background to perform tasks such as garbage collection and so on. The JVM does not wait for daemon threads to stop before exiting, while it does so for non-daemon threads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The output of the program:</p>
<pre><code class="java">Name: main
ID: 1
Alive: true
Priority: 5
Daemon: false
</code></pre>
<p>Each characteristic can be changed by setting a new value:</p>
<pre><code class="java">val t: Thread = Thread.currentThread() // main thread

t.name = "my-thread"
println("New name: ${t.name}") // New name: my-thread</code></pre>
<p>The same code can be applied to any current thread, not only the main one.</p>
